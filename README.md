The goal of drugTargetScreen is to implement the translational framework of genoproteomic studies for cardiovascular drug discovery. More details plase refer to our **manuscript**.

## Installation

You can install the development version of drugTargetScreen from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yangzhao98/drugTargetScreen")
```

## An applied example

To illustrate how the proposed translational framework can be used to help prioritize drug targets and accelerate the drug development process, we provided a step-by-step applied example to screening and verifying the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering drug targets of CETP inhibitors, statins (HMGCR), ezetimibe (NPC1L1), and PCSK9 inhibitors, which have been considered positive control examples in validating lipid-related therapeutics targets of coronary artery disease, as detailed here.
