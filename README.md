The goal of \code{drugTargetScreen} is to implement the translational framework of genoproteomic studies for cardiovascular drug discovery. More details please refer to our **manuscript**. 


## Installation

You can install the updated version of \code{drugTargetScreen} from [GitHub](https://github.com/yangzhao98/drugTargetScreen):

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("yangzhao98/drugTargetScreen")
```

## An applied example

To illustrate how the proposed translational framework can be used to help prioritize drug targets and accelerate the drug development process, we provided a step-by-step applied example to screening and verifying the low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)-lowering drug targets of CETP inhibitors, statins (HMGCR), ezetimibe (NPC1L1), and PCSK9 inhibitors, which have been considered positive control examples in validating lipid-related therapeutics targets of coronary artery disease, as detailed [here](https://yangzhao98.github.io/drugTargetScreen/articles/Codes_for_Paper_1.html).
